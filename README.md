### StreamSMS

StreamSMS is a hobby project designed to receive SMS messages from multiple phone numbers, moderate these messages through an intuitive interface, and display the approved messages on OBS or vMix via an RSS feed. This project aims to provide a seamless way to incorporate real-time audience interactions into live streams, making them more engaging and interactive.

While currently a hobby project, StreamSMS has the potential to scale to a production-ready solution if it proves successful.
